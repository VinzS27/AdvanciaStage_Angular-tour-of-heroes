<h1 align="center" id="title">Angular 17: Tour Of Heroes</h1>

## Goal
I recreated the tutorial of [Angular - Tour of Heroes](https://v17.angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes/toh-pt1) as it had some issues with version 17.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular 17**: A robust frontend framework used to build a dynamic, user-friendly interface for the application. 
- **Node.js**: Version ^18.13.0 or ^20.9.0 was used as the runtime environment to support Angular and manage dependencies.
